# Pix-er - a Simple and Better Image Viewer

This is a small, personal project for myself. I unfortunately discovered that things like this
have largely already been done, so I used other implementations as heavy reference for mine,
adjusting things as I saw fit (mostly readability and quality-of-life changes when I found them)

## Idea

I hate the default Windows 10 image viewer. It's slow (but sometimes it isn't?) and
doesn't let me use my left and right arrows to step through other photos in
the same folder. (but sometimes it does?)

I don't mind programs such as infranview, however, it has a lot of features I
simply don't need. I'd prefer something more lightweight.

So, I'm making Pix-er to have the thing I want. I'm uploading it here to share, if
anyone's interested.

## Estimated completion date

I dunno lol
